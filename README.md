# Deep Dream
This repository contains an implementation of DeepDream, as described in this [blog ](https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html) by Alexander Mordvintsev about Neural Network art.
See [original gallery](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPX0SCl7OzWilt9LnuQliattX4OUCj_8EP65_cTVnBmS1jnYgsGQAieQUc1VQWdgQ?key=aVBxWjhwSzg2RjJWLWRuVFBBZEN1d205bUdEMnhB) for more examples.
Similar to when a child watches clouds and tries to interpret random shapes, DeepDream over-interprets and enhances the patterns it sees in an image.
